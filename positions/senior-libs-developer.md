## What is Enso?
**From the business perspective**, Enso is a no-code interactive data transformation tool. It lets you load, blend, and analyze your data, and then  automate the whole process, simply by connecting visual components together.

Enso has the potential to disrupt the data analytics industry over the next five years.

**From a technical perspective**, Enso is a purely functional, programming language with a double visual and textual syntax representation and a polyglot evaluation model. It means that you can mix other languages with Enso (Java, JavaScript, Python, R) without wrappers and with close-to-zero performance overhead.
